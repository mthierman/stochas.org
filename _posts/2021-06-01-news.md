Please note that if you downloaded a developer release sometime in the past few months and happened to save a project in your DAW using that release, you may run into an incompatibility when loading that project using the latest version of Stochas. There was a bug related to plugin manufacturer code which has now been fixed. If you really need to recover that project, you will need to either reinstall that developer release, or build stochas setting the USE_LEGACY_COMPATIBILITY_PLUGIN_CODE to FALSE. Once you have that version loaded, you can load your project, then from within Stochas, click on Patch Options, Save Patch and save it to a file. You can then install the newer version, and load this patch into the current version using Load patch. 
If you did not install a developer release you should not be affected.
